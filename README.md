<p align="center">The #1 modpack to use for all common versions of Minecraft Java Edition (1.7.10 - 1.19.4)</p>

Although, we aren't quite at the 1.19.x stage yet. Right now, CheatBreakerX is in development. The versions being currently worked on include 1.8.9, 1.9.4, 1.10.2, 1.11.2 and 1.12.2 - though new versions will come soon. To preview these versions, you can download them from the latest successful workflow package found in the [Actions tab](https://github.com/CheatBreakerX/Client/actions).

This repository contains the source code of the base of the client (in the `core` folder) and all the supported versions (e.g. `versions/1.8.9/`). It works by implementation in Mixin, which you can dive into yourself by looking at the decompilation of [Lunar Client](https://github.com/Decencies/LunarClient), whom of which we are not associated with. The original base of this can be found [here](https://github.com/iAmSpace/CheatBreaker) for the former Forge port, or [here](https://github.com/Decencies/CheatBreaker) for the original source; both of which are only on 1.7.10.

*Why though? There are many CheatBreaker remakes/remasters/revives out there so it doesn't stand out...*

CheatBreakerX is an open source, community driven project, unlike many other CheatBreaker remakes/remasters/revives. We do not obfuscate our code to make it clear to everyone that this is not some "rat to get SkyBlock coins quick" scheme. This is purely a hobby that turned into a project - bringing CheatBreaker to every Minecraft version, which again, all other CheatBreaker remakes/remasters/revives do not have, only supporting 1.7.10 and 1.8.9. Another point for us; native support for mod loaders. We (will) support Tweaker (a sole installation), Forge, Fabric, and possibly Quilt, catering to everyone using all different configurations that want to use our mod.
